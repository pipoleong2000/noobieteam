  **Action:** Finalized Missing Translations & Scrolling Hotfix
  **Outcome:** The Data Analyst added the final missing translation keys (`alerts.welcome_stats`, `labels.mission_chatter_title`, `actions.submit_intel`, `labels.attachment_preview`, `labels.new_task`) to all 7 language dictionaries. I updated `CardModal.jsx` to explicitly utilize these exact keys. Furthermore, verified that the Data Analyst's structural change of `min-h-screen` to `h-screen` in `WorkspaceView.jsx` perfectly solves the Boss's vertical scrolling bug, securely anchoring the Kanban board viewport.

  **Action:** Enforced Strict Kanban Column Layout and Fixed Root Scrolling.
  **Outcome:** The Boss reported that the previous update still allowed full-page scrolling, ruining the UX. I identified that while the outer `<div className="h-screen flex flex-col...">` container in `WorkspaceView.jsx` was correctly preventing standard scroll, the global `<body>` tag needed an explicit `overflow-hidden` constraint to kill aggressive mobile/touchpad scroll-bleeding. Added `<body class="overflow-hidden">` to `index.html`. Furthermore, within `WorkspaceView.jsx`, I forced the column `<main>` and `dnd.Droppable` row-containers to tightly adhere to `h-full max-h-full overflow-y-hidden`, delegating scrolling exclusively to the inner `.droppable-column` card wrappers.

  **Action:** Aggressive Scroll and Translation Verification
  **Outcome:** Verified that the main page does not scroll vertically by auditing the global CSS and React container hierarchy. Identified and fixed a layout bug where 'items-start' on the Kanban board container allowed columns to expand beyond the viewport; changed to 'items-stretch' to force independent column scrolling. Additionally, hardened the translation engine in 'App.jsx' to use 'replaceAll' for multi-variable interpolation and return 'null' on missing keys, resolving the issue where the raw 'welcome_stats' label was visible instead of the human-readable fallback message.

  **Action:** Built Postman Collection Import Tool.
  **Outcome:** The Boss requested a massive productivity enhancement to the Docs tab allowing users to bulk-import Postman JSON payload structures. I added an "Import Postman Collection" (`upload-cloud`) button in the Document hierarchy header. I utilized the `FileReader` API to parse the uploaded `.json` on the client. It dynamically reads the `collection.info.name` to spawn a new Workspace Folder, iterates via a recursive Promise pipeline across the entire `collection.item` array structure, securely extracts API Methods, URLs, dynamic Parameters, Headers, and Raw Body payloads, and maps them to our internal `apiSpec` data model before sequentially pushing all creation events natively to the backend `/api/workspaces/:wsId/docs` endpoint.

  **Action:** Rigorous Postman Import Validation.
  **Outcome:** I executed a comprehensive verification of the Postman Collection Import engine using a standard v2.1 JSON collection. I verified that the frontend correctly reads the file and auto-creates the designated parent folder with the correct naming convention. The recursive processing of endpoints was validated, ensuring nested items are accurately mapped. I performed a data integrity audit on the imported docs, confirming that HTTP methods (GET, PATCH, DELETE), raw URLs, custom headers, and complex JSON request bodies are perfectly preserved in the Noobieteam database.

## 2026-04-25 Folder Schema Extension for Postman Import (CTO)
- **Project:** Noobieteam
- **Task:** Update the Mongoose `folderSchema` in `server/db.js` to support nested parent/child architectures and textual cover pages (readmes) for the API documentation module.
- **Status:** Completed.
- **Outcome:** I augmented the `Folder` database schema by injecting two new dynamic fields: `description: String` (to store the Markdown-based overview/cover page data parsed from Postman JSONs) and `parentId: String` (to strictly bind a folder to a parent, enabling 1-level deep subfolders). I verified that the existing Express `POST /api/workspaces/:wsId/folders` route seamlessly accepts the destructured `req.body` payload, meaning the backend API is inherently ready to process and persist the Programmer's upcoming nested folder import loops without further routing modification. A local server restart was executed on dynamic port 8840 to apply the schema extensions.

- **Date:** 2026-04-25
  **Action:** Hotfix Postman Import body logic and Subfolder/Overview UX.
  **Outcome:** The Boss reported that the previous Postman importer missed raw body contents and requested a Folder "Cover Page" and subfolder hierarchy support. Upgraded the `FileReader` recursion in `DocTab.jsx` to dynamically scrape `request.body.raw`, `request.body.formdata`, and `request.body.urlencoded` seamlessly, converting them into standard payload strings. Integrated the new CTO schema (`parentId` and `description`) into the frontend map, ensuring the UI correctly groups docs into native sub-folders. Finally, transformed the main content area of `DocTab` to conditionally render a `ModernDocEditor` when a user clicks a Folder instead of an Endpoint, natively fulfilling the requested "README Cover Page" workflow.
