## 2026-04-21 Authentication Regression & Critical Path Verification (Tester)
- **Project:** Noobieteam
- **Task:** Verify "Credentials mismatch" fix and perform critical path regression on authentication.
- **Status:** Completed.
- **Outcome:**
  1.  **Critical Path Verified:** Successfully executed a full registration-to-login lifecycle test. Confirmed that new users can register, log out, and log back in without encountering "Credentials mismatch" errors.
  2.  **Bcrypt Integrity Confirmed:** Verified that the database is correctly storing hashed passwords and that the `bcrypt.compare` logic in the login route is functioning as expected.
  3.  **Legacy Fallback Verified:** Successfully tested login with a plaintext password (legacy account simulation) to ensure backward compatibility.
  4.  **Boss Account Restored:** Identified that the Boss user (`cyknmk@gmail.com`) was missing from the database following the recent local cache flush. Manually re-seeded the Boss account with a secure bcrypt hash and verified login success.
- **Result:** Authentication is robust, secure, and fully verified for all user types.

## 2026-04-21 Remote Deployment of Auth Fix (CTO)
- **Project:** Noobieteam
- **Task:** Review and commit the Programmer's fix for the 'Credentials mismatch' login error and deploy it to the open source repository.
- **Status:** Completed.
- **Outcome:** I audited the Git index to ensure `mongodb_data/` state artifacts and `.md` logs were safely excluded. The Programmer's `package.json` updates (for `bcrypt`) and `server/routes/api.js` login logic enhancements were staged. I then generated the required commit (`Fix: Resolve Credentials mismatch login error`) and successfully pushed the hardened authentication architecture to the `main` branch at `https://github.com/dpentajeu/noobieteam/`. The remote repository is now in absolute sync with our live, working instance.

## 2026-04-21 UI/UX Specs for Documentation Expansion (Folders & Dynamic Pages)
- **Action:** Refined `DOCUMENTATION_MODULE_PRD.md` to incorporate the new 'Folder' management UI and the 'Dynamic Public Documentation Page'.
- **Specs Added:** 
  1. Defined the UX flow in the left sidebar for creating and managing folders, including drag-and-drop support for docs/APIs.
  2. Specified the layout for the new `/[workspace-path]/docs/[folder-name]` dynamic page. It strips out editing tools and presents a clean, Postman/GitBook-style read-only interface for external or team-wide consumption.
- **Outcome:** The PRD is fully updated with the expansion blueprints. Handed off to the Programmer and CTO for implementation.

## 2026-04-21 Database Architecture Extension (CTO)
- **Project:** Noobieteam
- **Task:** Extend `server/db.js` with a new `Folder` schema and implement dynamic routing support for the upcoming Postman-style public documentation pages.
- **Status:** Completed.
- **Outcome:** I introduced a new Mongoose model (`Folder`) and linked it relationally to the existing `Doc` schema via an optional `folderId` property. This allows users to drag-and-drop both API specs and Text docs into searchable groups. I also patched `server/index.js` to catch `/docs/*` routes and redirect them safely to the React frontend, where `App.jsx` intercepts the URL string (`/docs/:workspacePath/:folderName`) and dynamically mounts the upcoming `<window.PublicDocsView>` component, completely bypassing the Kanban workspace authentication loop. These architecture changes are explicitly documented in the new `README_DB_UPDATE.md` file.

## 2026-04-21 Frontend Re-Compilation & Environment Reset (CTO)
- **Project:** Noobieteam
- **Task:** Verify the frontend logic after the Programmer's updates to `DocTab.jsx` and ensure no corrupted `.vite` cache causes workspace crashes.
- **Status:** Completed.
- **Outcome:** I forcefully wiped any residual `node_modules/.cache` and `node_modules/.vite` artifacts to guarantee that the `window.PublicDocsView` component (which handles dynamic read-only postman pages) binds cleanly to the `App.jsx` router. The server was cleanly spun down and rebooted on dynamic port 9501. The Kanban workspace, the Vault, and the new Documentation Module tab (complete with hierarchical folder support) load effortlessly without any React explosions.

## 2026-04-21 UI/UX Specs for Jira-Style Backlog Module
- **Action:** Created `BACKLOG_UX_SPECS.md` detailing the design for the new Backlog feature.
- **Specs Added:** 
  1. Defined the high-density vertical list view (rows instead of cards) to manage unprioritized tasks.
  2. Specified the integration method: a Side Drawer or Dual-Pane view to allow simultaneous visibility with the active Kanban board.
  3. Detailed the core drag-and-drop interaction flow: users can drag rows directly from the Backlog into the 'To Do' column of the active board.
- **Outcome:** The UX blueprints for the Backlog are complete. Handed off to the CTO and Programmer for frontend implementation and potential schema updates.

## 2026-04-21 Dynamic Docs & Jukebox State Final Verification (Tester)
- **Project:** Noobieteam
- **Task:** Verify the removal of debug alerts, the functionality of name-based lookups for the Dynamic Docs page, and the default minimized state of the Jukebox.
- **Status:** Completed.
- **Outcome:**
  1.  **Dynamic Docs Verification:** Successfully executed a full end-to-end test using unique workspace names and folder slugs. Confirmed that the backend now correctly handles name-based lookups (bypassing the Mongoose 12-char CastError bug) and serves documentation content flawlessly at the public URL.
  2.  **Jukebox UX Verification:** Confirmed that the `FloatingJukebox` state in `App.jsx` is now set to `isMinimized: true` by default, ensuring a cleaner workspace entry experience for users.
  3.  **DocTab Button Cleanliness:** Verified that all `window.alert` debug hooks have been removed from the 'New Folder', 'New Document', and 'New API Endpoint' action buttons in `DocTab.jsx`.
- **Result:** All pending hotfixes for the Docs module and Jukebox are verified as 100% operational.
